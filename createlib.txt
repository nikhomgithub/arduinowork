To make library we need to file
1. hearder file    .h
    -list of all functions and variables   
2. source file     .cpp
    -actual code

/*
  Morse.h - Library for flashing Morse code.
  Created by David A. Mellis, November 2, 2007.
  Released into the public domain.

#ifndef Morse_h
#define Morse_h

#include "Arduino.h"

class Morse
{
  public:
    Morse(int pin);
    void dot();
    void dash();
  private:
    int _pin;
};

#endif

---------------------------------------

constructor :  used to create an instance of the class. 
               has the same name as the class, 
               no return type
public : meaning that they can be accessed by people using your library,
private: meaning they can only be accessed from within the class itself
#include "Arduino.h" : access to the standard types and constants of the Arduino language
